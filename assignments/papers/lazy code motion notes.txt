Lazy Code Motion by Knoop, Ruthing, and Steffen.

Important Notes:
- Initialize as late as possible while maintaining computational optimality.
- Only operates on control flow graphs with no critial edges. 
    + "Every edge leading to a node with more than one predecessor has been 
        split by inserting a synthetic node."
- Notes from when we discussed in class are still relevant.
- Still don't understand some of the minute details? But should look at the relevant slides.
